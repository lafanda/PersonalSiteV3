<p>&emsp;In September 2018, I began my fitness journey as a self-conscious teenager determined to improve my physical abilities. My motivation came from a gym class fitness assessment that highlighted my lack of strength, specifically my inability to do more than 5 push-ups. I dedicated myself to cardio and healthy eating habits and was able to lose a substantial amount of weight.</p>
<p>&emsp;From there, I took up calisthenics and set a goal to achieve 5 muscle-ups. Through consistent training and dedication, I achieved my goal and felt an immense sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p>&emsp;However, I eventually lost motivation and took a year-long hiatus.</p>
<p>&emsp;Determined not to let my progress go to waste, I joined a gym and have been consistently working out 6 days a week. I have since incorporated weightlifting into my routine and have seen great progress. My passion for fitness has even inspired my friends to join me in my journey. I currently run a PPL Arnold split and am constantly pushing myself to improve.</p>

                                    <p>&emsp;As a kid, I always heard the saying 'follow your passion' from my parents and teachers, but I never believed it to be possible. I thought that work was something that had to be endured, and that fun was reserved for games and Netflix. However, that all changed when I discovered the world of programming.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>&emsp;In 10th grade, I took my first coding class, an introduction to Python. The class started off slow, covering the basics like print statements, loops, and functions. But soon we had our first project: to recreate Microsoft Paint using PyGame. As I dove into the project, I found myself in a 'flow-state', completely absorbed in the task at hand. It was a feeling unlike anything I had experienced before, and I knew I wanted to chase it again.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>&emsp;From that point on, project after project and class after class, I was driven by the sense of accomplishment that came from turning my ideas into reality through code.I'm now proficient in multiple programming languages including Python, Java, C, JavaScript, HTML and CSS, and I am always seeking new ways to expand my knowledge and skills. I see coding as a never-ending learning opportunity, and I plan to continue growing and developing as a programmer for the rest of my life.</p>

                                        was, like many, Attack on Titan. I soon fell in love with the medium and went on a very 
                                        unhealthy marathon of watching show after show. This habit of binge-watching
                                         ended a long time ago, but I still indulge myself in 2-4 episodes of
                                          seasonal anime a week. To see more about my anime taste, check out

                            <p class="card-text">This website along side my email newsletter is my first attempt at
                                creating a full fledged website. Like my Simon Says project this too was inspired by the
                                same udemy course. I made the website useing HTML, CSS, Javascript and NodeJS. I used
                                EJS for the templating and am hosting the website for free on glitch.com. This is my
                                first project of 2023 and i am incredibly proud of it!</p>

                    <p> &emsp;Are you interested in gaining insight into the mind of an 18-year-old who is determined to
                        find their place in the world? Look no further! With my blog, you'll have the opportunity to
                        receive bi-monthly updates from yours truely. But my blog serves a higher purpose than just
                        providing updates on my life. I am using this platform to hold myself accountable to my goals.
                        Recently, I've taken on several side projects, learning opportunities, and personal goals that I
                        hope to achieve by 2024.</p>

                    <p> &emsp;To ensure that I stay consistent with these goals, I've found that journaling and tracking
                        my progress is crucial. I initially started by journaling my workouts which helped me stay
                        consistent in the gym and make progress, but it wasn't effective for my other tasks. I tried to
                        create a TikTok account for this purpose, but found that the time required to produce content
                        that I was proud of took too much time out of my day.
